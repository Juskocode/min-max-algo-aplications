  # How the Minimax Algorithm Works<br>
  
  The **Minimax algorithm** is a recursive decision-making algorithm used in game theory and artificial intelligence for two-player games, like Tic-Tac-Toe. It provides a systematic way to evaluate the possible moves in a game and predict the outcomes based on optimal play by both players. Hereâ€™s how it works:<br>
  
  ### Basic Concept<br>
  
  1. **Game Tree**: The algorithm constructs a game tree that represents all possible moves from the current game state. Each node in the tree corresponds to a game state, with branches representing possible moves.<br>
  
  2. **Maximizing and Minimizing Players**: The player who is about to make a move (let's call them **Max**) tries to maximize their chances of winning, while the opponent (**Min**) attempts to minimize Maxâ€™s chances. The algorithm evaluates these moves by assigning a score to each terminal node (win, lose, or draw).<br>
  
  3. **Score Assignment**:<br>
     - **Win for Max**: +1<br>
     - **Win for Min**: -1<br>
     - **Draw**: 0<br>
  
  ### Minimax Process<br>
  
  1. **Recursive Evaluation**: Starting from the current game state, the algorithm recursively explores all possible moves. For each possible move, it generates a new game state and calls itself again to evaluate that state.<br>
  
  2. **Backtracking**: Once it reaches terminal nodes (where the game ends), it backtracks and assigns scores to each node based on the scores of its children:<br>
     - If it's Max's turn, it selects the child node with the maximum score.<br>
     - If it's Min's turn, it selects the child node with the minimum score.<br>
  
  ### Alpha-Beta Pruning<br>
  
  **Alpha-beta pruning** is an optimization technique used to reduce the number of nodes that the Minimax algorithm needs to evaluate, improving its efficiency:<br>
  
  - **Alpha**: The best score that the maximizer (Max) currently can guarantee at that level or above.<br>
  - **Beta**: The best score that the minimizer (Min) currently can guarantee at that level or above.<br>
  
  ### Pruning Process<br>
  
  1. As the algorithm explores the game tree, it keeps track of the alpha and beta values.<br>
  2. If it finds a node that cannot possibly influence the final decision (i.e., a situation where Max can guarantee a better score than what Min can guarantee), it "prunes" that branch of the tree and does not evaluate it further. This helps in skipping unnecessary computations.<br>
  
  ### Conclusion<br>
  
  By utilizing the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, the Nightfall Tic-Tac-Toe game achieves a highly efficient and competitive AI opponent, making it an engaging experience for players. The AI evaluates moves strategically, ensuring that players face a significant challenge while enjoying the game.<br>
